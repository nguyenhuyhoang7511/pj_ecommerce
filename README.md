## Setup

## Available Scripts

Before start: using Node version 18

In the project directory, you can run:

## `enviroment`
```bash
The .env file is a text file used to store environment 
variables for your project. These variables typically 
contain sensitive or configuration-specific information 
that should not be hardcoded into your codebase. 
Instead, they are loaded into your application's
environment during runtime.

=> Copy file .env.xample to the root project. \
=> Rename file to .env. \
=> Fill in the api url value into the NUXT_API_URL variable

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
